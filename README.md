Scrapes subreddits and filters by flair or title


For pyperclip, if it doesn't work, run sudo apt-get install xclip. For more information see https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/

Issues:

* Text display is not centered, nor does it keep words together at the end of the line. Need to have words not be wrapped across lines, unless necessary
* Users can not create searches within the application
* Search selection display and prompts are a bit lackluster
* scroll.py Tooltip class does not have proper spacing. It does not account for blank lines between rows
* No command line options
* Scrolling down at the bottom of the page should return to the top of the page
